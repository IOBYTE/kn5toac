# kn5toac

I'm just playing around with the idea of using Assetto Corsa cars in Speed Dreams.

I'm trying to convert Assetto Corsa kn5 files to AC3D files just to learn how things work.  It's partially working  but has issues.  Once I get it fully working I will decide if the AC3D file should be modified to what Speed Dreams expects or just write the kn5 importers and use the kn5 files.

It should also be possible to generate a Speed Dreams configuration file from the ini and lut files.

This is for Windows only and requires C++ 17.
